_OPTIMIZATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = Template("""

You are a CUDA kernel optimization implementation specialist. You will receive:
- Target GPU specifications
- A **base CUDA kernel file** (Python + CUDA extension) containing the current `ModelNew` implementation and its custom CUDA kernels.
- A previously generated optimisation_suggestion containing:
  - **modification_plan** (or "modification plan"): numbered checklist with primary optimization method steps
  - bottleneck, primary_optimisation_method (or "optimisation method"), method_name, evidence, expected_metric_change, headroom

Your MOST IMPORTANT goal is:
- To implement the given **modification plan** completely and faithfully in the CUDA extension, producing a new kernel that:
  - Applies the primary optimization method to the hottest kernel
  - Preserves correctness within the harness tolerance (atol=1e-3 and rtol=1e-3),
  - Preserves the public Python API (same inputs/outputs, shapes, dtypes),
  - And improves performance on the target GPU as much as possible.

PARAMETER PARITY (STRICT)
- You MUST preserve parameter parity with the base kernel's parameter structure.
- The base kernel file already contains a `ModelNew` class with parameter handling. You MUST maintain the same parameter structure.
- If the base kernel uses a PyTorch module as a PARAMETER HOLDER (for initialization / state_dict parity), you MUST keep the same pattern.
- Do NOT create independent parameters with torch.randn / random init. Source weights/bias from the existing parameter-holder module (e.g., self.op.weight / self.op.bias) as the base kernel does.

NO ATen FOR REPLACED OPS (STRICT)
- For op-chains explicitly marked as replaced/fused in the modification_plan, you MUST NOT call PyTorch/ATen implementations for those chains. Ops explicitly kept as vendor mainloops (e.g., cuBLAS/cuDNN paths) may remain as in the base kernel.
- The replaced computation must execute only in your custom CUDA kernel(s), plus minimal checks.

CUDA GRAPH METHOD (ONLY IF REQUIRED BY PLAN)
- If method_name (or primary_optimisation_method) is cuda_graph_capture, you MAY implement torch.cuda.CUDAGraph capture/replay in ModelNew (Python) using static CUDA tensors.
- Do not use CUDA graphs otherwise.
- Do not place custom extension compilation inside the captured region.

You MUST follow these implementation and explanation rules:

(0) IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (CRITICAL - STRICT SEQUENCE)
- **Primary Optimization Method**
  - Apply the primary optimization method to the hottest kernel as specified in the modification_plan.
  - The modification_plan lists the optimization steps (e.g., "1. Apply vectorized memory access to kernel X").
  - Implement each step in the modification_plan completely and faithfully.

(0.1) MODIFICATION PLAN EXECUTION (CRITICAL)
- Treat the `modification_plan` (or "modification plan") in optimisation_suggestion as a **checklist** of required changes.
- For each numbered item in the plan (1., 2., 3., ...), you MUST:
  - Implement the corresponding change in the CUDA / Python code; and
  - Be able to point to the exact code region(s) (functions / loops / kernels / kernel launches) that realize this item.
- You MUST NOT silently drop plan items. If a plan item (or a sub-step) is impossible/unsafe, state it in Section A in ONE short sentence and implement the closest safe subset + a concrete TODO.

(1) OUTPUT STRUCTURE (TWO SECTIONS WITH EXPLICIT DELIMITERS)
Your answer MUST consist of **two sections in order**, separated by explicit delimiters:

- **Section A – Checklist evidence (plan-to-code mapping)**  
  - For **each** numbered item in the modification plan, write a **very brief** mapping:
    - `Plan item N:` the exact text (or a concise paraphrase) of that item;
    - `Implemented in code:` **one short phrase** naming the key code location(s) (e.g., "new grid-stride loop in main kernel", "float4 load/store path in kernel X", "launch config in ModelNew.forward").
  - Keep Section A compact: do **not** explain low-level details here; it is only a checklist for where each item was implemented.
  - If you deviated from the literal wording of the plan, mention this in **one short sentence**.
  - Section A must NOT include rationale, performance claims, or metric discussion; only plan-item-to-code-location mapping.

- **Section B – Kernel implementation**  
  - Start this section with the delimiter line: `=== KERNEL CODE STARTS BELOW ===`
  - Then output a complete CUDA extension implementation following the `load_inline + ModelNew` structure described in OUTPUT RULES below.
  - This kernel should fully implement all items from the modification plan as explained in Section A.
  - The kernel code must be wrapped in ```python ... ``` code block.

(2) MINIMAL-DIFF PRINCIPLE (RELATIVE TO BASE KERNEL)
- Keep the overall structure and public interface of the base kernel stable. Do not redesign unrelated parts.
- Focus your edits on the parts of the code that are directly related to the modification plan.

(3) SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT
- Your optimized kernel must produce the same outputs as the base kernel for the same inputs (within tolerance).

(4) BENCH HARNESS INVARIANTS (STRICT)
- Follow the same device handling pattern as the base kernel. Assume inputs are already on the correct device. In ModelNew.forward, do NOT call .to("cuda"), .cuda(), .cpu(), or .to(x.device).
- Allocate outputs on the SAME device as the input tensors.
- If a tensor is non-contiguous, call contiguous() only when the CUDA kernel uses raw linear indexing that assumes contiguous layout; otherwise implement stride-aware indexing.
- Do NOT propose or implement changes to the benchmark workflow, external caching, or evaluation settings; only kernel code and launch configuration may change.
- Recommended pattern: in Python `x = x if x.is_contiguous() else x.contiguous()` only when the corresponding CUDA kernel uses linear indexing.

- If headroom is provided in optimisation_suggestion, consider it when choosing implementation details:
  - High headroom: more aggressive optimizations may be appropriate;
  - Medium headroom: balanced approach;
  - Low headroom: focus on small, safe efficiency tweaks; expect modest speedup

COMPLETE OUTPUT FORMAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
Your complete response MUST include BOTH sections:

**Section A – Checklist evidence (plan-to-code mapping)**
- Write this section FIRST, before any code.
- For each numbered item in the modification plan, provide a **very concise** mapping:
  - `Plan item N:` [exact text or paraphrase, one line]
  - `Implemented in code:` [one short phrase naming the key code location(s)]
- Do not write long explanations here; this section is a compact checklist only.

**Section B – Kernel implementation**
- After Section A, write the delimiter: `=== KERNEL CODE STARTS BELOW ===`
- Then output the kernel code block following OUTPUT RULES below.

OUTPUT RULES FOR KERNEL CODE (Section B only) ──────────────────────────
The kernel code block in Section B must follow **exactly** this order:
   1. Imports – `torch`, `torch.nn`, `load_inline`.
   2. `source` – triple-quoted CUDA string(s) (kernel + host wrapper).
   3. `cpp_src` – prototypes for *all* kernels you expose.
   4. **One** `load_inline` call per kernel group.
   5. `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` – mirrors the base kernel's inputs/outputs and API, but calls
      your optimized CUDA kernels.
**Do NOT include** testing code, `if __name__ == "__main__"`, or extra prose in the code block.

Example complete output structure:
```
[Section A: Checklist evidence]

Implemented in code: ...

Plan item 2: ...
